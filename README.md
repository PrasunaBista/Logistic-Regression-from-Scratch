# Logistic-Regression-from-Scratch


In this project, I have implemented logistic regression from scratch in Python. Additionally, I have performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Cancer dataset, conducted forward and backward selection of features, and evaluated these each time with evaluation metrices to determine the best combination of the available features in the dataset .

## Logistic Regression Implementation
I have created a logistic regression model from scratch using Python. The implementation includes the necessary mathematical functions for logistic regression, such as sigmoid activation function, cost function, and gradient descent optimization.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
I conducted exploratory data analysis on the Cancer dataset to gain insights into the data. This involved analyzing the distribution of features, identifying correlations, handling missing values, and visualizing key statistics using libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

## Feature Selection
I performed feature selection using forward and backward selection methods to identify the most relevant features for predicting the target variable. For each method, I evaluated the performance of the model using appropriate evaluation metrics and compared the results.

## Evaluation
Throughout the project, I evaluated the performance of the logistic regression model and feature selection methods using various evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC. By deducing the evaluation metrics each time, I determined the best approach for predicting the target variable on the Cancer dataset.
